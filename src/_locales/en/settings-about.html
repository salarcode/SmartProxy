	Using proxies cannot be easier with SmartProxy. Think of it as configure once and forget
	solution.
	With SmartProxy you don't need to change your proxy manually or turn it on and off.
	All you have to do is to tell SmartProxy that you want to enable proxy for your desired
	website with just one click.
	After that, when you visit that specific website, SmartProxy will act and all you data for
	that website will be transferred though the proxy, without you doing anything.
</p>
<p>
	SmartProxy brings a handful of features to users from beginner one to advanced one which
	some is listed here:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Just enable proxy for one site on a tab and everything there will have proxy enabled
		automatically. This feature is called proxy-per-tab</li>
	<li>Automatically detect when to enable or disable proxy to certain websites based on rule
		patterns</li>
	<li>Easily switch between many proxy servers as your active proxy server setting</li>
	<li>Switch on proxy for current site you are on it with one click</li>
	<li>View current website items and requests and decide whether to enable proxy for them with
		one click</li>
	<li>Easily switch between proxy modes or enable proxy for all domains</li>
	<li>Backup/Restore settings and rules</li>
</ul>
<br />
