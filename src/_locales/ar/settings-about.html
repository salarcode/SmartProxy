	Using proxies has never been easier with SmartProxy. Think of it as configure once and forget
	solution.
	With SmartProxy, you don't need to change your proxy settings manually or turn it on and off.
	Simply tell SmartProxy to enable the proxy for your desired website with just one click.
	After that, whenever you visit that specific website, SmartProxy will automatically route
	all your data through the proxy without any further action needed from you.
</p>
<p>
	SmartProxy offers a variety of features suitable for both beginners and advanced users, including:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enable the proxy for a single site on a tab, and everything on that tab will automatically
		use the proxy. This feature is called proxy-per-tab.</li>
	<li>Automatically detect when to enable or disable the proxy for certain websites based on rule patterns.</li>
	<li>Easily switch between multiple proxy servers as your active proxy server setting.</li>
	<li>Enable the proxy for the current site you are on with just one click.</li>
	<li>View the current website's resources and requests and decide whether to enable the proxy
		for them with one click.</li>
	<li>Easily switch between proxy modes or enable the proxy for all domains.</li>
	<li>Backup/Restore settings and rules.</li>
</ul>
<br />
